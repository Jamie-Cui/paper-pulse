# Security/Crypto + LLM Paper Aggregator

Automatically fetches and summarizes papers from arXiv and IACR related to security, cryptography, and large language models.

## Features

- 🔄 Daily automatic updates via GitHub Actions
- 📚 Fetches papers from arXiv (cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG) and IACR ePrint
- 🤖 AI-powered summaries using ModelScope API
- 🗂️ Keeps last 7 days of papers
- 🔍 Flexible keyword filtering via config file (OR between lines, AND within lines)
- 📋 BibTeX export for citations
- 🎨 Minimal, clean card-based UI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up GitHub Secrets:
   - `MODELSCOPE_API_KEY`: Your ModelScope API key

4. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository

5. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `master` (or `main`), folder: `/ (root)`

## Keyword Filtering

The system uses `keywords.txt` to filter papers. Edit this file to customize which papers are included:

- **Each line = OR logic**: Match any line
- **Words on same line = AND logic**: Must match all words
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#`

Example:
```
llm                    # Matches papers with "llm"
neural backdoor        # Matches papers with BOTH "neural" AND "backdoor"
federated learning     # Matches papers with "federated learning"
```

## Usage

### Automatic Updates
Papers are automatically fetched daily at 00:00 UTC via GitHub Actions.
